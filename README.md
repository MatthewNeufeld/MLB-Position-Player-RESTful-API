# MLB Position Player RESTful API

Developed an API with get, post, delete, put, and patch methods designed for storing and organizing player data. In 
this project, I used Express.js, Node.js, Mongoose, and Body Parser. I also used Postman and Studio 3T for testing the API. The player
schema is composed of the player's name and team, as well as same eight summary statistics used by baseball-reference.com

# What I Learned

- Strengthened my skills in Node.js and Express.js
- How to use Mongoose to develop a schema and model
- How to utilize Body Parser in developing APIs
- How to valuable Studio 3T and especially Postman are for testing a web application with a back-end
